# CSSE230Project
repo for group csse 230 final project

please keep in mind that the stable branch is for stable versions only, when we reach a milestone or have a code that we want to base all future branches off of, please MERGE master into stable. DO NOT COMMIT DIRECTLY TO STABLE unless it is for small bug fixes/cleanup.

As for commiting to master, REFRAIN from commiting directly to master, it is much more apporiate to create a new brach, make your changes, then MERGE your new branch into master.

this system really helps to keep code convolution down and merge conflicts to a minimium.
